00:06:53 after I actually have to leave at 7 so they will be him and not going to be thinking about them I love this man very cool so please I'm out of your release date today then learn about sao.net Community for ages doing 
00:07:52 as dinner Plymouth Meeting a little different and how many people a year are doing actively doing any type of work that involves makes TCP API everybody write how many views post minutes how many think you're using it bullying at 1 I remember when it was this little blue weird world things 
00:08:51 based on my LinkedIn learning course why were materials are we talking about are examples come straight from there plain sight in Revolutionary Road glaring at me like hitting between two other spots are you supposed to bathe everyday cuz I develop are back if I'm leaving janier at my right around the corner here in Fishers and I do all of our back-end API development 
00:09:50 well that means if I don't get lunch bringing up our web application and seeing things like nice people and car views and having buttons to quickly build the Jason for me for my request for crafting all of us like to do that all by hand soap anything I can do to make that easier it's something I'm going to be interested in Beyond me in my team I work with to react to dover's doing our web application we have a person doing our native iOS we have somebody doing our native Android development we have an application tester when they're ready to start I don't have 
00:10:49 share this information you can tell how great it is I also I was able to get the projector play anything about that was really really pixelated and hard to read so I will try the zoo relevant things if I forget to shout at me the most of the room has used post lamp but I'm going to try to go into areas that you may not necessarily as you work through 
00:11:48 this is a pretty familiar a preferred be LinkedIn course and things you see and hear may not necessarily be implemented in the way that you would do it in a normal production application but I needed to hack in a place to do things like three string parameters and so it was easier to do that than try to go through some other things and for the purpose explaining it I really wanted to have that but Simplicity and keep the focus on managing the where is Greenbrier Motors in cookies or or what not as opposed to software format. 
00:12:47 wish questions as we go along I think his first professional job 79 episode with Scotty came out of a teleporter I've been doing this diapers 
00:13:46 and the team can see first document but they also have a very readily available tool an exercise so diving Anna basic operation you brought up curl what's the other product do you would use if you weren't using Postman which is free Charles Alma 
00:14:45 which was a lot of what we care about if you have the luxury of having a web-based interface moving its Pro Network tap it doesn't run my soak my point there is there's a product called smartbear which company is far better that used to make soap UI for those folks that came from the soap days then moved to rest my point was he part of an excellent point get a GitHub has tons of Postman collections out there but you don't see a ton of curl collection or you don't see a ton of the soap UI collection as a pain point the reason this really becomes interesting is you can use the fabric of what you just talked about across now the entire organization but across your music Community as well 
00:15:44 is so closely related to sport button up there import file folders import a postman collection environment data dump curl command and so on so you can even take her face around all of those parameters if you remember if you've never tried it sucks and it goes away 
00:16:43 but you do have an environment that requires Build It Up we are here and give them some I don't go ahead and make a simple request turn off hdcp here and I've already run all of these plans so I am going to just is right off the bat all of the HTTP methods 
00:17:42 in a request with curl I just typed in Custer headed out as an option to save method custom so far so crazy and then you can use it as a request 
00:18:41 but I really like this Sunday download options well second download you request a PDF dialogue I save it off into the folder the cover monitor 
00:19:40 we just got his back raw sex I hear it's already set in this particular maybe I run values and more complex results on the jump ahead and get another so I have this is a very rudimentary ticket board tickets and stuff like that 
00:20:39 I don't know next week or Madden racing data which I can collapse nice I don't have to try to read we have some other options have you have the unformatted version and then preview the third option here is useful when you're requesting a web page because that page of such a standard rendering of that response 
00:21:38 by my Mac clearly so very convenient so are things like our status code I want locally with no seconds and size of the box also do you say to a file and we'll come back to that saves example some I'm trying to understand what's going on and why is this thing not responding the way I am parameters 
00:22:37 scorebig app actually developing something is affecting my response throw it in to grab another response what's happening within our system is involved watching the changes and compare how things are working overtime we also have things are cookies will come back to these overtime but we can if we are responsible server we can see all of the 
00:23:36 so anything got that type of free standard parameters here and have a great guy and they could do some testing is there ways to automated we won't get into those up tonight really trying to focus on the individual productivity pieces do advance I do really want to get into some of that test thingy guys fight abusing that so I'm going to leave that one to open up 
00:24:35 the reason I chose this particular Ralph and it's one of those places where you can argue whether the architecture for the most if you guys are going to run into even if you just getting normal websites web applications you may be wanting to get some results back and of course any type of test utility or four HTTP requests should support that results. Our API returns page data and I've got things 10 + well I don't want to stimulate 
00:25:34 better caging and I want to control how many items are returned we have a couple of course I have a p.m. parameter and a PS4 Android page number and eight size detective so I will select these and send and pray big number one a size one little item for total Pages for pick up my added those parameters in where we had nothing before in this program stop putting clothes in entries for page number in cage size the value of 1 
00:26:33 the address bar here don't change PS2 it changes down below what is I'll start crafting I request using the address bar but I definitely overtime prefer to manage them down below by poppy s that in here I can turn it on and turn it off in the state of Maine at the states associated with the request so I'm experimenting with different values maybe I'll create different entries in the stable turn things off and turn things back on in affect my request in different ways and when I'm working saving things 
00:27:32 I can come back and still have them on you for suspended between session I can share them with my team and that lets us see different ways of working with the FBI 
00:28:31 so I'm going to just disable these to work with URL but I'm going to say you probably run into a few words with the weapon anyway you probably run into needing to URL encode things and The Franciscan that is affected my query string and we have the spaceship noted the empress and 2% 26 but there's this thing in plain sight if I open the context menu on here 
00:29:30 bottom of menu so I did that so I selected that text and now that has been coated with percent 20 instead of the bus Plus change weather cheat code 
00:30:29 Converse the buses to Fort mCP I first ran into it right here delete this one away from it. I can delete it from the Expo before I do that how many people who use post lab volcanic Latin exactly one person canker sore 
00:31:28 call Kennedy Boston or maybe it's play JavaScript lights and now we have a JavaScript like syntax of the parameters and when I put into this I had two of them disabled their denoted with double slashes being there, too. There's still associated with my request but their ignore I can run, then and I can delete that and when I'm done evaluate it and look how it's affected rest of my requests are you move that one that I didn't need and I restored the two that I commented out just by going into editing that JavaScript 
00:32:27 I'm looking at this all right show me how many people work with cookies yeah there's there's two things I was just going to look at an API and in and I say this with a reasonable estimate of being fair if your urine codeine do URL or you're sending cookies you have to ask yourself this is this the best API for you in the first place because 
00:33:26 anything that you have to put in the URI means that you're exposing your application to weird things specially if it has names okay I know I know I get it I get that but my my point to you there is is simply what I found just like with extraction another object when you run into that API you're better off putting an object around that takes your API call and does the proper thing so you can send a post to it and then have it converted and then that way you're never stuck in the land of oh my gosh I've done something terrible to this API just because I didn't think about my data I don't disagree so I will skip over the cookies 
00:34:25 they are manageable is over here cookies but they are managed by domain work with them up or use them and you can modify them whatever you need to do Plex suspect though it whether it's in the context of the CIA or requesting individual web pages so I jump back to the first request to your and this one what 
00:35:24 logic around different headers so no response we can have it back this user agent Postman run time 7:15 to inject it into a request for us and the temporary headers section we can see things like our very first thing on browser that's weird cancer specifying are headers on our request 
00:36:23 and Postman know something intellisense built-in speakers to use that are built into Postman that we can select from most of them you'll ever use but probably used up like user agent so I was like that in a Turk and now because this is for my Wednesday class I'm going to go did you not request with my custom value and now it's echoing back on you custom. And Dave do you find that not knowing that that was there caused a lot of 
00:37:22 are API calls to certain sites that have robot. Text and think you're something that shouldn't fail thoroughly I'm finding it at friends that I have to do something so I don't usually run into it when I'm just I don't usually use Postman against things out of my control sincerely I don't care to request something from Google necessarily yours I usually ignore I was bringing it up because the numerous number of apis that are out there if you go at it with Postman and you're hitting a production box most of the specifically will just consume your API request and kill it because they think you're hitting the wrong thing 
00:38:21 absolutely and then doesn't even respond there are other areas even in here where it will give you more information I Transamerica if you're going to be manually adding one of these headers to your request you know exactly which one do you're not going to go in randomly select something like am I going to 
00:39:20 change we can also just like a browser I know that this particular thing is returning text we can see that in our body here but I wanted to give me a call I wanted to give you a zoom in on that I started typing at the top of the well I know what that location Jason's like created keeping focused on the problem 
00:40:19 not on but you're going to be such a value application Jason send is automatically selected a text before I even have a return version and based on that particular responded with content type is text HTML based on that it was able to 
00:41:18 and the point there is it is just a polite request send it to me that way if the API doesn't support it you're still going to get whatever they ship back I just disabled I haven't deleted it still going to send it so if I send this again without her we're back to the mall to text give me the otherwise all that I work with a company that was pretty long in the tooth of their apis and had a number of issues only because if you didn't send a header guess what it's fit back TDS so it is assumed that you would set it not that you wouldn't have said it and because of that it started sending back raw data 
00:42:17 there was no switch to catch if it's not there don't just send back raw data and so it's interesting to me how many apis fail by one setting something to something that shouldn't ever do like you wouldn't put PDF that right and then vice versa by not even providing it so I find it really helpful to run through those to see what you expect your API to do because most of your portable project managers p.m. when they tell you to make an API they don't say and it's in this rain these are the things will do yep manto valuable tool. 
00:43:16 what were the security guards won't actually convert your base64 for you so it won't take the Jason and wrap it so bike power meters we also have a bulk edit option for R headers nice if you want to keep a set of them away but unlike our query string parameters is right next to bulk edit and before I go in there I'm going to just take something and zoom in what's that Heinrich reset LinkedIn Jason so 
00:44:15 you working with Quest as pretty, thing Define precepts so put that preset button drop-down and it'll give you an option for manage presets and I just fine user agent and except through I'm going to go and you're just a thing with those presents tell is the thing it cloned into the request so it's not just using these precepts going to clone them as we've already got them to find it's going to set them on top you're going to end up with you 
00:45:14 I go to I now have those Define twice but if you're just getting started and you've got those known values II unfortunately this is an actual clone basically I think about why you're changing your free site that you need to and so I'm going to disable that 
00:46:13 brushing my hair to Brown. Just a reminder you can create custom ones to you don't have to follow the standard to the ground been working on burgeoning already I am I really don't like putting version indicators in the RL so we've been they do that on YouTube so I got a custom header that I use for identifying which version of route table is it that was it better always frustrate me with that is most of the big companies we work for our black 
00:47:12 Play Tops black budget they built it they put away Ten Years Later to look at it again so the fact that somebody thinks that they're going to migrate somebody off of that API in the blind to me is well it's next to the asinine because how you going to go tell all those people to stop making those calls that you paid to take their money from to get we got it when you change the structure of an object it was one particular route that was affected because if you send something extra and Jason anyway it's supposed to just ignore it or identify which version of our route and it works beautifully and nothing else has changed 
00:48:11 I word I'm going to get rid of are you having either contact location to log into yours so this particular API also supports 
00:49:10 words here and where to find some search capabilities in here as well so this is we saw paging support group awaiting you searching and that's what I decided to do so normal application I think. And first thing I notice is the request 
00:50:09 body why might that be there request from server getting some data also have none selected nobody so if you're working with an HTML form post and can replicate that for you chosen form data and I get that same familiar table gets her I was going to say when people hear the word form data and they see an API calls his multiform they think it's 
00:51:08 same thing it is not I want to hear has a drop down where I can choose between text fields and files so you're trying to text me and say you got a route to handle you don't have to think about all that multi-part form think about all of the boundaries all of that vile is my things and if I was going to upload a file value we also get a ball headed now it doesn't 
00:52:07 we can get some other options but I really like the most because that's why I use is the raw option and that gives us a nice text box where we can put they die but we're going to send to the server so this case because I've actually already written this before I'm going to go grab it from other example in Richland County Json data into my body and formatting on the road again 
00:53:06 server go over to my headers and I've not said took that and there I can catch her by content type but it's a whole lot easier to come over to this little drop down and she was from a free populated set of five types Jason that was giving me next to text highlighting and if for some reason I thought of something vile instead of pasting it and I did some ugly thing like that hidden in plain sight unify button I push the button 
00:54:05 it still is prudent to use something like Jason Lynch or something like that when it's really long or complex because it's amazing the amount of problems it exactly it was sunglasses we would get back 
00:55:04 is there a keyboard shortcut for the FIFA final singing show bottom right corner of shortcuts and but it does pop-up Elizabeth I should have very often so those are our basic interactions with whatever we get request request for you but chances are 
00:56:03 system requires more than one request typically it's the application the organizing it gives us a convenient way to organize our request everything was a postman in organized spaces my workspace drop-down I work spaces fall into two categories of either personal work spaces as your own stuff or more space so if your company is not cheap and paper to my house and you can creatine work spaces 
00:57:02 and all of your team gets access to the work spaces they can work out a blabbering on them create Apple share things but not it's convenient though because inside we have these things called collections are you in the group buying collection so I want you to create a new collection here and I'm going to call this post is and create July I already got you requested that created let me save 
00:58:01 first thing is going to give me an option to nanak well URL isn't necessarily the most helpful thing but it took this one I remember he is my ATI and I'm going to say slip a clutch or what does nice little confirmation that you selected the red collection I'm going to do the same thing here I'm going to save search 
00:59:00 order that Normie want drag him around highlights complexions Moana remember to work spaces can be more personal and we don't use what's this button or actions I can share the collection but we do generally and asked if it was warm and I want to save it then I choose bottle option flexion D2 what other different formats involve 
00:59:59 collection on copy of it they can work with that mess around with it and not mess up anything else I keep those off separate they can redeem it maintain productivity in their environment we can share those but against almost the entire way. Within a collection of my respect we can add a folder and folders are just way to subdivide clutch on pretty one cup Lord text structure goes into 
01:00:58 but I export and then like 10 can import them and work with them and see that same structure sobre things out by the routes that we have so we have musically have different structure built up a couple of reclast what's new showing switch over a moment ago when we created our collection descriptionari I personally need to get much better about doing it 
01:01:57 documenting our stuff I know I need to get better but it has a really good easy way to document rapid say all things simple that put the description on my collection you can do that for other folders are not going to but you can be physically. Guy Ford this individual request to where I was doing it before I go into this Ellipsis and go to edit I never do that first thing 
01:02:56 Channel all things about a request I don't need to open another dialogue for it there's a pencil icon I wanted to rename search for Buy I just renamed it name reflected in the Explorer but we can do more like putting that little trying description Pine boards that Payback thanks Manny 
01:03:55 how to request I get through conflict so I save it I don't say no right everything is good till next time I'm not sure exactly what's causing that I've seen it more than a few times drive me crazy but we can do more than that Fort Wayne Indiana 
01:04:54 I know 
01:05:53 a guy so and there's exactly White a little bit less detail when to authorize going to save that example 
01:06:52 close that cat what does something interesting there's an examples drop down 0 Play-Doh send it to Cason failed we have 404 not filed and save this example here and I'm going to authorize failure sample clothes we see that reflected this is a way for you to see that was a failure 
01:07:51 the status was 404 mean knowing where all of these are broken Postman environment yeah it's nice to know I can look up there but generally Ellipsis button there's a arrow icon it open the panel let's start showing us 
01:08:50 documentation that we've been answering all things sample API Boards of all things sample Avi boards I look at the scripture I look at that particular request search for words that contain something in the description that's starting to show things I can click over to the Builder and that's great but where my example that's weird public docks comes in handy all of these things so I can go across my current environment turn down to my user assured you are always somebody 
01:09:49 but I'm now giving space view of my API including all of the documentation that I have an example in formation copying it expand to see the whole detail we can change format so I'm doing things in node well that's what we do our documentation for ABI collaborate 
01:10:48 I go to authorize see comments 0 but we also see we have different examples examples by justifying success and failure we can see update based on select what's another really good way for people on your team if you could collaborate with you understand what's going on here exactly maybe I expected how it works what it does capture. Quest employee document there are ways to make it through this internal to my particular team 
01:11:47 space personal project ATI then that's where public docks little configuration wizard that we can walk through that will make that documentation available at a publicly-accessible a tie your elbows I can share with other people side of my organization if I was to publish this massive. Credibly so tickets to the public so I have put the
