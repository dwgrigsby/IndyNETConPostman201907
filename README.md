I did a RAW sound capture via my iPhone from the back of the room and ran it through a quick default transcription via Natural Voice Recognition without any adjustment to gain, silence removal, model and shared it for you with the folks that attended. I had to leave early due to other commitments so it is incomplete. I like to give back especially when there is free pizza, so a hearty thank you goes out to the sponsors and you two!
